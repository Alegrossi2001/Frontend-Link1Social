# What is this project?

It's a cool fucking project designed for handling all sorts of social aspects. It holds various "packs", all done through microservices. The backend is built in ASP.NET and hosted on Azure.

## Project Structure

Wherever possible, we are using and creating reusable components that are extremely dynamic and accept TS objects for content.
These components are currently held in the "Styled" folder and I am trying to slowly remove all other components present that aren't these super dynamic beasts that will be used to create our in-house mega component library.

# Social Packs

## 1. Standard Pack (Free)

This handles the default aspects of a social media management tool:
- Basic Analytics (Dashboard)
- Schedule Post (Schedule)
- Connect Social Media Profiles and create groups(Connect)
- Save post template (Create)
