# Key Technologies and libraries(WIP)

## ESLINT + PRETTIER

This ensures good coding practices and maintains the inhouse style that Link1 Studios has.

## Redux (TO ADD)

This is used to handle global variables such as UserInfo, UserPreferences, RuntimeData and SocialMediaProfiles.

## Material UI

The main graphical choice for the software. Chosen for its simplicity. 

## Axios

Preferred to React's basic fetch functionality for its ability to handle promises, which is ideal to create the secure system people will come to expect from Link1 social.

As per Link1 standards, we always try to minimise the amount of dependency we have on external libraries when it comes to developing logic, always preferring to create our own logic libraries in-house.
